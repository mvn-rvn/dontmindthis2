<p>Depending on the model of your Intel WiFi adapter, your adapter is compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac and 802.11ax wireless standards. Operating at 5GHz or 2.4GHz frequency, you can now connect your computer to existing high-speed networks that use multiple access points within large or small environments. Your WiFi adapter maintains automatic data rate control according to the access point location and signal strength to achieve the fastest possible connection.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR ALL USERS OR DISTRIBUTORS:</p>
<p>Intel wireless LAN adapters are engineered, manufactured, tested, and quality checked to ensure that they meet all necessary local and governmental regulatory agency requirements for the regions that they are designated and/or marked to ship into. Because wireless LANs are generally unlicensed devices that share spectrum with radars, satellites, and other licensed and unlicensed devices, it is sometimes necessary to dynamically detect, avoid, and limit usage to avoid interference with these devices. In many instances Intel is required to provide test data to prove regional and local compliance to regional and governmental regulations before certification or approval to use the product is granted. Intel's wireless LAN's EEPROM, firmware, and software driver are designed to carefully control parameters that affect radio operation and to ensure electromagnetic compliance (EMC). These parameters include, without limitation, RF power, spectrum usage, channel scanning, and human exposure.</p>
<p>For these reasons Intel cannot permit any manipulation by third parties of the software provided in binary format with the wireless LAN adapters (e.g., the EEPROM and firmware). Furthermore, if you use any patches, utilities, or code with the Intel wireless LAN adapters that have been manipulated by an unauthorized party (i.e., patches, utilities, or code (including open source code modifications) which have not been validated by Intel), (i) you will be solely responsible for ensuring the regulatory compliance of the products, (ii) Intel will bear no liability, under any theory of liability for any issues associated with the modified products, including without limitation, claims under the warranty and/or issues arising from regulatory non-compliance, and (iii) Intel will not provide or be required to assist in providing support to any third parties for such modified products.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Many regulatory agencies consider Wireless LAN adapters to be &quot;modules&quot;, and accordingly, condition system-level regulatory approval upon receipt and review of test data documenting that the antennas and system configuration do not cause the EMC and radio operation to be non-compliant.</p><br />
